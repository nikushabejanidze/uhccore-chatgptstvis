## Why can't I join my server?

Probably because the world is still being generated. By default, UhcCore
will pre-generate all chunks within the world border, which can take a while
depending on the border size and your server performance. Pre-generating
the world will greatly reduce the amount of lag while playing the game.

While the world is being generated, you can see the progress in your server
console, to get an idea of when it will be done.

## Why does my server crash/freeze while generating the world?

The chunk pre-generator used by UhcCore does not play well with some
older versions of Minecraft (in particular, `1.12.2`). If you are running
UhcCore on such a version, or if your server doesn't have enough performance,
the server might crash or freeze during pre-generation. Here are a few tips
on how you can solve this problem:

1. If the server just appears frozen, wait a few more minutes.

2. If you're using Spigot, try using [Paper](https://papermc.io) instead.

3. Play around with the `pre-generate-world` settings in config.yml.

4. Try increasing `timeout-time` in [spigot.yml](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-configuration/).

One way to completely avoid this problem is to set `enable: false` under
`pre-generate-world` in config.yml. This will disable pre-generation completely,
which is NOT recommended. Doing so will likely increase the amount of lag while
playing. As a workaround, you could use another plugin to pre-generate the world,
such as [Chunky](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chunky.81534/).

## Can I use this plugin on a free hosting service, such as Aternos?

While the plugin should "work", it might not work *well* on a free hosting
service, because you probably won't get a server with good performance for free.
What this means is that you should expect it to take a bit longer to generate
the world (see ["Why can't I join my server?"][q1]), among other things.

If your server crashes while generating the world, there's not much you
can do except upgrade to a server with better performance, or try
the tips mentioned in
["Why does my server crash/freeze while generating the world?"][q2].

## How can I add a custom kit/craft to the game?

You can add them in the kits.yml and crafts.yml configuration files. There are
a few examples included in [the default configuration files][q4], to help you
get started (those examples can also be removed if you prefer).

When entering the value for an item in the kit or crafting recipe, you'll
need to use a custom JSON format that UhcCore uses for items. This format is
not documented and is generally not meant to be edited directly. Instead, you
can use the `/iteminfo` command (provided by UhcCore) to get a correctly
formatted JSON string to paste into your configuration file. The `/iteminfo`
command will include all information about the item stack in your hand,
such as item type, amount, display name, lore, enchantments etc.

!!! warning

    When upgrading (or downgrading) the Minecraft version of your server,
    it is possible that some of your kits/crafts no longer work correctly if
    the Minecraft item format has changed significantly. One example of such
    an update would be ["The Flattening"][flattening] which happened in
    Minecraft 1.13.

    In order to fix the items in your configuration files, you can put all
    the items into your inventory (or a chest) before upgrading, and then use
    the `/iteminfo` command again after Minecraft has upgraded your items to
    the new format. Note that this only works when upgrading your Minecraft
    version. If you are downgrading, you will need to re-create the items.

[flattening]: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.13/Flattening

## Why is my config/kit/craft not working or missing?

The most likely reason is that you have a syntax error in your YAML file,
which means that UhcCore can't read the configuration properly. To resolve
the issue, try the following steps:

1. Make sure you have saved the config file and restarted your server.

2. Check the YAML code for syntax errors. You can use an editor with
YAML support, or an online tool like [YAML Checker](https://yamlchecker.com).

3. Check the server console output for any errors or warnings.
Even if your config is valid YAML, it might contain an invalid setting value.

4. If the steps above didn't help, or you've run into an error message that you
don't understand, feel free to ask for help on [the Discord server][discord]!
Please tell us what you were trying to do, what (if any) error message you got,
and any other relevant details about what went wrong.

## Can I add this plugin to my existing server? Does it have multi-world support?

While there's nothing stopping you from adding the UhcCore plugin to an existing
server, keep in mind that the plugin has its own world management system,
and may delete player data from your default world. See
["How and where does UhcCore load/store worlds?"][q3] for more details.

UhcCore does not support multi-world plugins such as MultiWorld or Multiverse,
because it uses its own world management system, and may need to modify global
settings that would affect all worlds on the server.

!!! tip

    As an alternative, you can use a proxy server, which allows your players
    to switch between your UHC server and other servers with other worlds.
    Here are some alternatives to consider:

    - [Velocity][velocity]: A modern and fast alternative.

    - [Waterfall][waterfall]: An improved fork of BungeeCord.

    - [BungeeCord][bungeecord]: An old project with a large plugin ecosystem.

    You may also be interested in the `bungee-support` section in the
    config.yml file. As the name implies, those settings only work when using
    a BungeeCord (or Waterfall) proxy, but Velocity support could be added in
    a future UhcCore update.

[velocity]: https://velocitypowered.com
[waterfall]: https://github.com/PaperMC/Waterfall
[bungeecord]: https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord

## How do I add a custom lobby, deathmatch arena or underground nether?

UhcCore has support for loading custom [WorldEdit][worldedit] schematics
for these purposes. The schematics should be located in the `plugins/UhcCore/`
directory, and the filename should be `X.schem` or `X.schematic`, where `X`
is the name of the schematic (see below).

| Schematic name | Description | Related settings in config.yml |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lobby` | Lobby used before the game starts. | `lobby-in-default-world` |
| `arena` | Deathmatch arena for the end of the game. | `arena-deathmatch` |
| `nether` | Underground nether template. | `underground-nether` |

!!! note

    Note that in order to use this feature, you must have WorldEdit installed
    on your UhcCore server. You can use WorldEdit on any server to create the
    schematic file, and then rename and copy the file to the right location.
    A usage guide for schematics [can be found here][schematic-docs], but you
    can also search the internet for more in-depth tutorials and video guides.

## How and where does UhcCore load/store worlds?

Each time the server is started, UhcCore will create a world to play the
game in. By default, a random world is generated, but you can also use the
`pick-random-seed-from-list` or `pick-random-world-from-list` options in
config.yml to use a specific seed or custom map instead.

Regardless, UhcCore will create a new world with a random name for the
overworld, nether and end dimensions (if `enable-nether` and `enable-the-end`
respectively are set to `true` in config.yml). These random world names can be
found in the storage.yml file after the worlds have been created
(note that the overworld is called `normal`).

??? example "Example: storage.yml file"

    ```yaml
    worlds:
      normal: 61337d18-59ba-4a0e-a054-62a059da282a
      nether: 9898f9c1-1bd5-4181-a4f1-dec8587d0858
      the_end: 0e1361ca-9776-4730-a111-21e87302429d
    ```

Before creating the new world, UhcCore will also look in the storage.yml
file to see what the previous worlds were called, and then try to delete
those worlds automatically. The UhcCore worlds are stored in the same directory
as your other worlds, the location of which can be configured in Spigot/Paper.

!!! note

    One of the main takeaways from the above is that UhcCore ***does not use
    the default worlds***, specified using `level-name` in server.properties,
    excepting a few circumstances:

    - The `lobby-in-default-world` setting in config.yml.

    - Player data and other global information which is always stored in the
    default overworld by Spigot/Paper.

## How can I play on a custom map or use a custom world seed?

Please have a look at the `world-seeds` and `world-list` sections in your
config.yml file. By default, both of these features are disabled in the config,
but if you do enable them, make sure you *don't* enable both at the same time.

UhcCore can pick a random seed or map from the configured list, but you can
also choose to create a list with a single option, to always use the same one.

!!! note

    Note that if you use the `world-list` settings, UhcCore ***does not***
    actually load the world you list in the configuration. When the server
    starts, UhcCore will create ***a copy*** of the listed world (think of it
    as a template), and then load ***the copy*** as described in
    ["How and where does UhcCore load/store worlds?"][q3]. This means that
    you will need to load the world in singleplayer or on a different server
    if you want to make changes to the map.

    If the overworld, nether or end world is not present for the listed world,
    a new one will be generated instead of creating a copy.

## How can I configure the server to restart after each game?

When the game ends, UhcCore will issue the `/restart` command, or if that
fails, the `/stop` command. The restart command is [documented here][restart],
but you can also search the internet for more in-depth guides.

As an alternative, if you are using a server control panel (for example, one
provided by a hosting service), there may be an option for automatically
restarting stopped/crashed servers. But there is no standardized way of doing
this, so you will need to find out how it's done and whether or not it's
supported on your control panel yourself, by searching the internet.

[restart]: https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-commands/

## How can I send you my log and/or config files?

If you are experiencing an issue, such as a bug or a crash, you will usually
need to send us your server log and/or config files. Without them, it's
really hard for us to tell what went wrong. Because these files are
usually quite large and contain a lot of text, you usually can't send them
to us directly in [the Discord server][discord]. There are a few alternatives:

- Upload the file automatically using the `/upload log` or `/upload config`
commands provided by UhcCore. The files are then uploaded to
<https://paste.md-5.net> and a message is sent to you in the chat with a link
to the file. This link can then be shared with a helper on Discord,
so they can see the file.

- You can also upload the files manually yourself, to <https://paste.md-5.net>
or an alternative like <https://paste.gg>, <https://pastebin.com> or
<https://gist.github.com>. The server log file is located at `logs/latest.log`,
and the main config file is located at `plugins/UhcCore/config.yml`.

- You can also send the log files as a private message to an `@Helper` on
the Discord server, but we highly recommend one of the alternatives described
above. If you only send the log/config as a private message, you can only get
help from one person, whereas anyone can help you if you send a paste link.

## Where can I find the default configuration values? How do I reset to default?

The default configuration values for most files in the `plugins/UhcCore`
directory [can be found here][configs]. Just make sure to change the version
string in the URL so that it matches the version of UhcCore you have installed.

In order to reset all of the settings in a configuration file to their default
values, just delete the file (or move/rename it, to keep a backup). When the
server is started, UhcCore will generate a new config file with the default
values.

[configs]: https://gitlab.com/uhccore/uhccore/-/tree/1.20.15/src/main/resources

## Where can I read more about configuration, commands etc? Is there a wiki?

There is currently not a complete wiki, but it will be added to this website
at some point in the (hopefully not-so-distant) future. The previous plugin
maintainer [did create a wiki][old-wiki] which you are free to use if it
helps you, but keep in mind that it is slightly outdated and far from complete.

As an alternative while the new wiki is being created, you can find information
about all configuration options as comments in the respective files (see
["Where can I find the default configuration values? How do I reset to default?"][q4]).
You can also find information about the UhcCore commands by running
`/help uhccore`, `/help uhccore 2` for the next help page and so on.
In order to view more details about a specific command, use `/help <command>`.

If there's something you can't find information about using the above methods,
you can always ask in [the Discord server][discord], or look at the plugin
source code, if that's your thing.

## Does UhcCore have an addon API?

There is currently not a proper API for UhcCore, but stay tuned, because this
is planned for a future UhcCore release! As of yet, there is no ETA (see also:
["When will the next update be released? What features will it have?"][q7]),
but I would estimate it to be at least a few months away, because it takes time
to design a *good* and easy-to-use API. There are also a number of old systems
in UhcCore that will need to be rewritten to better support such an API.

Either way, if you're *really* eager to make an addon, and you are already
familiar with Java programming and plugin development, you *can* technically
use the UhcCore plugin JAR as a dependency and pretend that it's an API.
This has been done in the past, since the previous plugin maintainer used
to refer to the plugin JAR as an API. Below are Gradle/Maven dependency
snippets in case you're interested:

!!! example "Snippet: UhcCore repository"

    === "Gradle (Groovy DSL)"

        Add this to `repositories` in your `build.gradle`:

        ```groovy
        maven {
            name "uhccore"
            url "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/uhccore/-/packages/maven"
        }
        ```

    === "Gradle (Kotlin DSL)"

        Add this to `repositories` in your `build.gradle.kts`:

        ```kotlin
        maven {
            name = "uhccore"
            url = uri("https://gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/uhccore/-/packages/maven")
        }
        ```

    === "Maven"

        Add this to `repositories` in your `pom.xml`:

        ```xml
        <repository>
            <id>uhccore</id>
            <url>https://gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/uhccore/-/packages/maven</url>
        </repository>
        ```

!!! example "Snippet: UhcCore plugin JAR dependency"

    === "Gradle (Groovy DSL)"

        Add this to `dependencies` in your `build.gradle`:

        ```groovy
        compileOnly "net.zerodind:uhccore:1.20.15"
        ```

    === "Gradle (Kotlin DSL)"

        Add this to `dependencies` in your `build.gradle.kts`:

        ```kotlin
        compileOnly("net.zerodind:uhccore:1.20.15")
        ```

    === "Maven"

        Add this to `dependencies` in your `pom.xml`:

        ```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>net.zerodind</groupId>
            <artifactId>uhccore</artifactId>
            <version>1.20.15</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
        ```

!!! warning

    Again, the plugin JAR is ***not*** a proper API, so you should expect
    breakages even for "patch" versions (for example, a method may be renamed,
    or a class might be removed). There will be no documentation on how to use
    the plugin JAR as some kind of API, you will have to look at the source code
    yourself. With that said, if you have questions about the source code, you
    are welcome to ask in the `#dev` channel on [the Discord server][discord].

## Can I add my own custom scenarios?

You will be able to in the future, once UhcCore has an API. Technically you
can already create an addon with scenarios by compiling against the plugin JAR,
but this is not recommended unless you know what you're getting into. See
["Does UhcCore have an addon API?"][q8] for more details.

Another way of adding your own scenario would be to edit the source code of
the plugin, which might be easier until there is an API, since you don't have
to deal with dependencies. If you do this, please consider making a contribution
to add your scenario to the plugin, which means that everyone can enjoy it
once the next UhcCore update is released. See
["I want to help contribute code to this project, where do I start?"][q6]
for more details on how to contribute your code.

## Who is the main developer/maintainer/owner of this plugin?

That would be me! I am a computer science student who loves programming and
Minecraft, and have been using UhcCore on my private server for a while.
I took over the plugin ownership in June of 2022, because Mezy (the previous
owner) stopped maintaining the plugin due to a lack of interest in the project.

You can find me online on these places:

- Discord: `zerodind#5905`
- GitHub: <https://github.com/0dinD>
- GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/0dinD>
- SpigotMC: <https://www.spigotmc.org/members/zerodind.1572489/>

## How can I increase the chances of a feature being added?

I am not currently accepting donations or any other kinds of payment for
implementing a specific feature. That's because this is a hobby project of
mine which I do besides my studies and work, which means that my time is
limited.

With that said, there are a number of ways in which you can increase the
chances of a feature being added, or speed up the development rate:

- When requesting a feature, help me out by clearly describing how you think
it should work (for example, game mechanics, edge-cases to think about or
implementation alternatives). The more details you go into, the less work it is
for me when implementing the feature.

- While you *can* discuss feature requests and bug fixes on the Discord server,
consider [opening an issue][issues] on GitLab. This helps me keep track of
the feature request or bug, and makes sure it doesn't get lost in an old
Discord conversation if it takes a while before I have time to fix it.

- You can of course also contribute code yourself in order to implement the
feature, and I highly appreciate your help! This does require you to have some
previous knowledge of Java programming and/or Minecraft plugin development.
To get started, see
["I want to help contribute code to this project, where do I start?"][q6].

## When will the next update be released? What features will it have?

There is currently no complete roadmap, but you can always take a look at
[the milestones in GitLab][milestones] to get some insight into current and
future updates, if a milestone has been created for them. Please note that I
generally won't be able to give out an ETA unless the release is almost ready.
That's simply because I don't have that much time (and can't reliably predict
when I have it), seeing as this is a hobby project that I work on
besides my studies and work.

Having said that, you can always search through the message history on the
Discord server in case I've hinted at a thing or two, and I may answer some
questions about updates if you ask nicely (and accept "I don't know" for
an answer).

You can also read the `[Unreleased]` section at the top of
[the changelog][changelog] if it exists to see what features and bug fixes have
already been implemented and will be released in the next update. If you are
familiar with Git, you can also [view the list of commits][compare] since the
previous version (using its tag) and the head of the `main` branch. Just make
sure to select the right tag matching the version you want to compare from.

## How can I try the latest improvements to UhcCore before they are released?

The easiest way to try the latest UhcCore improvements (if they have not yet
made it into a release) is to download a snapshot build. Snapshot builds are
built from specific Git commits, and are, as the name implies, a snapshot of
the UhcCore release that is currently being developed. Some features may not
be finalized yet, and could change again before the final release.

[Here is a link to the latest UhcCore snapshot build.][latest-snapshot]
Simply download the plugin JAR file (not the `javadoc` or `sources` JAR), and
then install it on your server. Please report any problems you find with the
snapshot build, via [GitLab][issues] or [Discord][discord].

You can also find previous snapshot builds, by browsing the
[GitLab CI jobs][ci-jobs] and finding the `build` jobs. On the CI job page,
there is a button which allows you to browse the job artifacts, where you can
find the snapshot build.

Apart from the latest snapshot build, old snapshot builds are only kept for a
maximum of 10 days. If you would like to try an older snapshot version of
UhcCore, you can check out the relevant commit using Git, and build the plugin
from the source code, using the instructions in the project README file.

## I want to help contribute code to this project, where do I start?

A good starting point is to read the [README][readme] and
[CONTRIBUTING][contributing] files. That information may help you get started,
but it doesn't go into all the details and is probably not as beginner-friendly
as it should be. Until I've had time to improve that piece of documentation,
I would highly encourage you to join [the Discord server][discord] and ask in
the `#dev` channel if you have any questions. You can also use this channel
to ask questions about and discuss the UhcCore source code.

## Is this plugin free? Will it stay that way?

Yes! This plugin is licensed under the terms of the [GPLv3][gplv3], which
means that it is [free software][free-sw] (in addition to being free of
charge). It will most likely stay that way forever, because
[changing the license][converting] would require permission from *all*
previous code contributors.

[gplv3]: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html
[free-sw]: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html
[converting]: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#Consider

## Am I allowed to make my own version of (fork) the plugin?

Yes, this is one of the basic rights granted by the GPLv3 license (see
["Is this plugin free? Will it stay that way?"][q5]). However, do note
that if you decide to release your fork to the public, it must also be
licensed under the GPLv3 or a compatible license, and
[you must release the source code][release-source] to the public.

!!! note

    Using a privately made fork of the plugin on your public server
    without releasing the source code *is* allowed, as long as you
    [don't release the fork][release-source] to the public.
